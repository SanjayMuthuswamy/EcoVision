# 🌳 Deforestation Detection using Deep Learning  

> An AI-powered model that detects **deforestation** from satellite images using **ResNet-18 (Transfer Learning)**.  
> This system helps monitor environmental changes automatically and accurately.

## 🚀 Overview  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify satellite images as **forested** or **deforested**.  
Built with **ResNet-18** and **transfer learning**, it achieves high accuracy even with limited training data.

### Applications:
- 🛰️ Satellite image analysis for forest cover changes
- 🌿 Environmental monitoring and conservation
- 📊 Forest management decision support

## 🧩 Features  
✅ Analyzes before/after satellite images to detect deforestation  
✅ High accuracy classification using transfer learning  
✅ Simple and intuitive user interface

## ⚙️ Installation  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SanjayMuthuswamy/EcoVision.git
