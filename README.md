# 🌳 Deforestation Detection using Deep Learning  

> An AI-powered model that detects **deforestation** from images using **ResNet-18 (Transfer Learning)**.  
> This system helps monitor environmental changes automatically and accurately.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify satellite images as **forested** or **non-deforested**.  
Built with **ResNet-18** and **transfer learning**, it achieves high accuracy even with small datasets.

### Applications:
- 🌲 Automatic deforestation detection  
- 🛰️ Comparison of before/after satellite images  
- 🌍 Environmental monitoring and policy analysis

## 🧩 Features  
✅ Detects deforestation in before/after satellite images  
✅ Utilizes transfer learning with ResNet-18  
✅ High accuracy, even with small datasets  
✅ Plots training accuracy per epoch  
✅ Supports both single-image and batch predictions
