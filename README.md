# 🌳 Deforestation Detection using Deep Learning  

> An AI-powered model that detects **deforestation** from images using **ResNet-18 (Transfer Learning)**.  
> This system helps monitor environmental changes automatically and accurately.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This project trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify satellite images into **forested** or **non-deforested** areas.  
It uses **ResNet-18** with **transfer learning**, achieving high accuracy even with limited datasets.

You can use it to:
- 🌲 Detect deforestation automatically  
- 🛰️ Compare “before” and “after” satellite images  
- 🌍 Support environmental monitoring or policy analysis  

---

## 🧩 Features  
✅ Detects deforestation in before/after satellite images  
✅ Uses **transfer learning** with **ResNet-18**  
✅ High accuracy on **small datasets**  
✅ Plots **training accuracy per epoch**  
✅ Supports **single-image** and **batch predictions**
